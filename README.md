# üöÄ Background
Specializing in serverless application development with AWS Lambda, I thrive in the cloud environment.

My proficiency extends to both NoSQL databases like MongoDB and DynamoDB, as well as SQL databases such as MySQL and SQL Server.  I am adept at the entire CI/CD lifecycle and excel in developing RESTful APIs to create seamless and robust applications.

Passionate about tackling diverse and complex development challenges, I approach each project with enthusiasm, viewing challenges as opportunities for both personal and professional growth. As a quick learner, I embrace new technologies and methodologies, keeping pace with the rapid evolution of the tech industry.

Beyond the code, I find joy in sharing my knowledge and insights. My approach to technology is not just about problem-solving; it's about embracing imagination and innovation.
